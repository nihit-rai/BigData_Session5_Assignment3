Loading the Dataset:-

grunt> Pokemon_Data = LOAD 'Pokemon.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS(S_no:int,Name:chararray,Type1:chararray,Type2:chararray,Total:int,HP:int,Attack:int,Defense:int,SpAtk:int,SpDef:int,Speed:int);

Ques 1: Find the list of players that have been selected in the qualifying round (DEFENCE>55).

Command -
grunt> selected_pokemon_list = FILTER Pokemon_Data BY Defense>55;
grunt> dump selected_pokemon_list;
grunt> STORE selected_pokemon_list into 'Problem1' using PigStorage(',');

Ques 2: State the number of players taking part in the competition after getting selected in the qualifying round.

Command:-

group_selected_list = Group selected_pokemon_list All;
count_selected_list = foreach group_selected_list GENERATE COUNT(selected_pokemon_list);
STORE count_selected_list into 'Problem2' using PigStorage(',');

Ques 3: Using random() generate random numbers for each Pokémon on the selected list.

random_include1 = foreach selected_pokemon_list GENERATE RANDOM(),Name,Type1,Type2,Total,HP,Attack,Defense,SpAtk,SpDef,Speed;
STORE random_include1 into 'Problem3' using PigStorage(',');

Ques 4: Arrange the new list in a descending order according to a column randomly.

random1_desending = ORDER random_include1 BY $0 DESC;
STORE random1_desending into 'Problem4' using PigStorage(',');

Ques 5: Now on a new relation again associate random numbers for each Pokémon and arrange in descending order according to column random.

random_include2 = foreach selected_pokemon_list GENERATE RANDOM(),Name,Type1,Type2,Total,HP,Attack,Defense,SpAtk,SpDef,Speed;
random2_descending = ORDER random_include2 BY $0 DESC;
STORE random2_descending into 'Problem4' using PigStorage(',');

Ques 6: From the two different descending lists of random Pokémons, select the top 5 Pokémons for 2 different players.

limit_data_random1_descending = LIMIT random1_desending 5 ;
limit_data_random2_descending = LIMIT random2_descending 5 ;
dump limit_data_random1_descending;
dump limit_data_random2_descending;

Ques 7: Store the data on a local drive to announce for the final match. By the name player1 and player2 (only show the NAME and HP).

filter_only_name1 = foreach limit_data_random1_descending Generate ($1,HP);
filter_only_name2 = foreach limit_data_random2_descending Generate ($1,HP);
dump filter_only_name1;
dump filter_only_name2;
